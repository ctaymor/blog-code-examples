This repo holds example code for blogposts from tech.taymor.io.

You are free to check the code out to explore and better understand the examples. 

The project is divided by year at the top, and under that, examples for each post will live in an eponymous folder.

WARNING: These are examples for understanding. I don't recommend copying them for use in production. They may also be stale examples, based on my best understanding at the time of publication. I make no promises that I will update examples for current versions of languages, or if I learn a better way to do things.

They may not be full projects with all dependencies, though I will try to at least provide the version of the language (and testing framework if applicable) that they were written with.
